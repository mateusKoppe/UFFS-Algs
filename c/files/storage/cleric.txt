Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies.
For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.
