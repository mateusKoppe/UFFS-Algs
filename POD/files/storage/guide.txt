The greatest strength of bards is their sheer versatility.
Many bards prefer to stick to the sidelines in combat, using their magic to inspire their allies and hinder their foes from a distance.
But bards are capable of defending themselves in melee if necessary, using their magic to bolster their swords and armor.
Their spells lean toward charms and illusions rather than blatantly destructive spells.
They have a wide-ranging knowledge of many subjects and a natural aptitude that lets them do almost anything well.
Bards become masters of the talents they set their minds to perfecting, from musical performance to esoteric knowledge.
Clerics combine the helpful magic of healing and inspiring their allies with spells that harm and hinder foes.
They can provoke awe and dread, lay curses of plague or poison, and even call down flames from heaven to consume their enemies.
For those evildoers who will benefit most from a mace to the head, clerics depend on their combat training to let them wade into melee with the power of the gods on their side.
